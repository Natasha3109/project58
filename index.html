<p>I have watched many sereis but my favourite sereis is Just Add Magic.It is a popular sereis and has 3 sereis based on it.It is a nice pass time.This sereis is based on a magical cookbook which chooses the protecters of the book itself and has magical recepies for example the shut em shortcake which makes you shut and give up gumdrops which makes you give up something which is very special. let me tell you the story of the season 1=Season 1
In the town of Saffron Falls, teenage girls Kelly, Darbie, and Hannah are best friends who love cooking. While making a cake for Kelly's grandma's (who has a mysterious illness and cannot talk) birthday, the girls make a recipe using an ancient mysterious cookbook they find in the attic of Kelly's house. The recipes have strange names, like "Shut'em Up Shortcake" and "Hazelnut Healing Tart", and require unusual ingredients, such as "Cedronian vanilla" and "Taurian thyme". The girls visit Mama P's shop to get the ingredients for recipes. Mama P reveals that she knows what the ingredients are and the girls conclude that Mama P knows about the magic because she appears to have extensive knowledge of magical ingredients.[5]

Kelly, Darbie, and Hannah investigate the magic recipes and face the temptations of using magic to help overcome the everyday challenges of being middle school girls. Furthermore, they discover that Kelly's odd neighbor Ms. Silvers also has a connection to magic. The girls realize that they are the protectors of the magical cookbook and that there were many others before them, three of whom were Mama P, Ms. Silvers, and Grandma Becky. Among all this, Kelly has one main goal: to find the magical recipe that will fix her grandmother's mysterious illness. As the girls work together, they find out that Kelly's grandma Becky is under a curse, and so is Mama P.(whose curse does not let her leave Saffron Falls ) and Ms. Silvers (whose curse does not let her play the piano in public). Then, they bake a curse-breaking cake which breaks Grandma Becky, Mrs. Silver, and Mama P's curse. Except, it also brings back Chuck.</p>
